# Contributing to Blokdoc

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Blokdoc as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the documentation with details of any API changes.
3. The PR should work on the main development branch.
4. Once your PR is approved, it will be merged.

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint rules defined in the project
- Write tests for new functionality
- Document public interfaces with JSDoc comments

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript props interfaces for component props
- Follow the project's component structure

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests. Report a bug or request a feature by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

### Bug Reports

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

1. What version of the project are you using?
2. What operating system and browser are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

### Feature Requests

When filing a feature request, make sure to:

1. Explain the problem your feature would solve
2. Explain how you think the feature should work
3. Explain why this feature would be useful
